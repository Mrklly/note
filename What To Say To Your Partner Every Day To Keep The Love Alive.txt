Your smile makes my heart skip a beat.
How lucky i am to have you in my life.
How much you mean to me.
I'm amazed when i look at you.
I just wanted to let you know,you changed my life without even trying.
I may not be your first love but i want to be your last.
I want to be with you.
I don't want to next you.
I want't to be in your arms.
I don't want to call you.
I'll annoy you.
Feel your breath.
Hear your heart.
Hold your hand.
Piss you off.
I know i'm not perfect and you'll never find someone who cares or loves you more than me.
I promise to support you in whatever you do.
I will always be by your side,say stupid things then take it all back.
I just want to say ..... you make me feel alive.
that’s not enough ― not even close  这远远不够，还差得远呢？
